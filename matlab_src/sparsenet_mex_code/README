This files correspond to a slightly modified version of the CGF source code used by Bruno Olshausen and to compiled binaries on Mac, linux x32 and x64 for Matlab R14 (version 7).
The Makefiles have been modified to produce Octave compatible files. To compile for Matlab for Matlab switch back to `mex'. 
 
To compile for your architecture, simply type make in the nrf folder and then in this folder (and hope you don't get an error).
